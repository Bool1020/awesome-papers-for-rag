## Introduction

The retrieved documents often contain a list of passages which are ranked by their relevance score to the question. It would be costly to directly input these passages into the LLM. One one hand, the relevance score of these passages does not necessarily indicate their usefulness for answer generation, which could introduce noise to the LLM. On the other hand, the length of the list could exceed the length limit of the LLM. Thus, the evidence distillation (also called compressor) component is introduced to select and compress the retrieved content.
